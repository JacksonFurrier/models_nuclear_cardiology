The method is labaled \"nuclear\" because the gamma photons are the result of radiactive decay.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Is it dangerous?\nThey are completely safe and the uptake and radiation exposure during a heart scan is usually around 1.5 mSv, which compared to the yearly background radiation exposure 2.4 mSv, is negligible.\n:::\n\n\n## Single-photon emission computed tomography\n\nDuring this class, we will focus building models to solve problems in Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).\n\n## Visualization\n\n\n\n## Base materials\n\nThe motivation and the archetype of this class is written in [oftankonyv](http://oftankonyv.reak.bme.hu/).\n\n",
