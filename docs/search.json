Optical flow\n\nClassical approach This methodology is based on the assumption of brightness constancy , which means that the intensity of a point between consecutive frames remains the same. This can be formalized as follows \\[I(x, y, t) - I(x + u, y + v, t + 1) = 0, \\] where \\(w = (u, v)\\) is the displacement vector between the frames. This leads to an underdetermined system of equations, needing further constraints to overcome the aperture problem.\nRegularized models There can be various techniques to regularize the aperture problem, where most naturally the smoothness constraint can be posed, where one can optimize the following functional \\[E = \\iint_{\\Omega} \\Psi(I(x + u, y + v, t + 1) - I(x, y, t)) + \\alpha \\Psi(|\\nabla u|) + \\alpha \\Psi(|\\nabla v|) dx dy,\\] where \\(\\Omega\\) is the extent of the entire image \\(I(x, y, t)\\), \\(\\nabla\\) is the nabla (gradient) operator, \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant and \\(\\Psi(.)\\) is a loss function. One approach to solve this optimization problem to use the calculus of variations to compute the first variation and as a result get a necessary condition for the extremum. The BCC can be approximated by the Taylor series expansion, more specifically \\[\\frac{\\delta I}{\\delta x}u + \\frac{\\delta I}{\\delta y}v + \\frac{\\delta I}{\\delta t} = 0\\], wherewith the optimization problem can be rewritten as \\[E = \\iint_{\\Omega} \\Psi(I_{x}u + I_{y}v + I_{t}) + \\alpha \\Psi(|\\nabla u|) + \\alpha \\Psi(|\\nabla v|) dx dy.\\]\nParametric models Instead of posing regularity constraints point-by-point on the pixels of the projection frames, one can group pixels into regions and estimate the motion of the regions themselves. This way one assumes that the motion can be estimated by a set of parameters, therefore the model looks as follows \\[\\hat{\\alpha}= \\underset{\\alpha}{\\operatorname{argmin}} \\sum_{(x,y)\\in R} g(x, y) \\rho(x, y, I_{1}, I_{2}, u_{\\alpha}, v_{\\alpha}),\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is the set of parameters determining the motion of the region \\(R()\\), data cost term is \\(\\rho()\\), \\(g()\\) is the weighting funtion that determines the influence of pixel \\((x, y)\\) on the total cost, where \\(I_{1}\\) and \\(I_{2}\\) are the consecutive frames.\n\n\n\n2.

In a nutshell, if one approaches the Equation 1 by series expansion2, one arrives at the following in matrix notation \\[\ny = Ax.\n\\]\nNow the problem of reconstruction is not solved but rather transformed into a numerical issue, namely in real-life the matrices \\(A\\) are sparse and sized \\(\\approx 10^{12}\\), since not all the line of response (LOR) will pass through a voxel3. During the development of reconstruction methods, multiple drawbacks need to be addressed.
